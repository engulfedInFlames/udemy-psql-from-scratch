1. Create an empty database without any tables. 

2. Then click at the top File > Preferences > Paths > Binary Paths

3. Then scroll down to PostgreSQL Binary Path and the PostgreSQL 16 radio button to set as default

4. Then in the Binary path for that option, type in C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin

5. Lastly, follow the same restore steps with the empty database, but do not enable the "Data Only" option.
